From our Collingwood hub, we’re involved in exhibitions, panels, publication launches, workshops, screenings, chook raffles, martial arts tournaments and home-style cookouts in collaboration with friends like The Good Copy, Deja-View Cinema, IPF, the Melbourne International Film Festival and Creative Mornings.

We also help run Rooftop Cinema. ‘Iconic’ is overused, but we dare you to name a more influential cinema located on the top of a building that used to be the headquarters of Melbourne’s communist party. We extend one of the world’s most distinctive cinema experiences onto the internet and into the spiciest email newsletters in the game.
