From ‘Worksite pic of the week’ to ‘Tradiefork Fridays’, our work with Builders Academy is about being genuine and authentic with tradies—an audience that can smell inauthenticity as sure as they can tell a coach screw from a lag bolt. Tradies regularly tag us in their posts and message us their own work pics without any incentive. We’ve become a genuine part of their day on the job. And the funny stuff we publish delivers just as many website leads as serious educational pieces and direct calls-to-action.
